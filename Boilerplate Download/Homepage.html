    <h1>What is HTML & CSS?</h1>
    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    </center>


    
    	<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is a machine-readable language that gives instruction to a computer to display a website.</p>
        <p>It can be broken down into two categories. 'Hyper Text', meaning hyper links to other pages within or outside the website and 'Markup Language' referring to the text inside the tag symbols which defines the structure, content and display of the web page.<br>
        HTML consists of elements. An element generally has an opening tag, closing tag and relevant info in between. Some exceptions arise, such as an image tag, which does not need a seperate closing tag. It is considered self closing.<br></p>

        <p>The general structure of a basic HTML document starts with the tag <-!DOCTYPE-> then <-html->. Both  inform the computer what language to expect.<br>
        The next tag, which nests within the HTML tag, is the <-head-> tag, anything within this tag is not displayed on the website, but instead provides administrative information about the html document to follow. It can be thought of as the brain of the page.<br></p>

        <p>After this comes the <-body-> tag, which nests inside the <-html-> tag and below the <-head-> tag. The body tag includes all of the content for the web page.<br></p>
<center>
        <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
      </center>
        <p>CSS stands for 'Cascading Style Sheet'. CSS controls how your page is presented and how it looks. Think colour, size, decoration.<br><br>
      

        CSS can be added to a webpage in 3 different ways, or a combination of each.<br>
<ol>
      <li>In-line - The CSS is added inside the HTML tag, adding a style or attribute to a specific html element.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Inside it's own <-style-> section within the structure of the html document.</li><br>
      <li>Or inside a seperate document, called an external stylesheet, which you then link to in the head section using a <-link rel-> which tells the computer it should use the stylesheet linked and apply it to the html.</li><br>
</ol>

      CSS needs to be told what part of the html to apply itself to.<br>
       To do this, we use a selector. Next it needs a property, like a colour, then that property needs a value, like pink.<br>

      Best practice is to use an external style sheet as when seperated from the html it can be easier to read and less convoluted.
      Though, there can be a combination of inline CSS and external style sheet CSS when you want to add styles to a certain html tag instead of applying the style globally.<br>

<h3>Links</h3>
      Links are a clickable text, image or shape that leads to another page on the same site, (relative path) or to an external website (absolute path).<br>
</center>     
      They are written using anchor tags and a hyper reference. They can also link to elements on the same page using a # symbol or using prefixes such as mailto: or tel: for a link to email or telephone contact respectively. Using a target attribute you can have the link open in the same browser page (using self) or in a new browser page (using blank).<br>

      Link states change whether a user has interacted with the link. There are four states, unvisited, visited, hover or active. Each state has default styling.
